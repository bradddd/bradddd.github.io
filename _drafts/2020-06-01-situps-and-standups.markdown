Situps and standups
I was recently having a conversation with an engineering leader, and he was curious about standups. His company wanted to run agile, so his product leader set up standups for the team as well as the accompanying ceremonies to round out the experience. Anyways, he was only a few months into the new process, but he was pretty jaded. He wanted to know if this is how it was as other companies. He also wanted to know how other companies were ok with wasting so much time. 

asked about standups and how to run them etc.

Like in golf, you play it as it lies. By this, I mean you need to talk to your team. Engineers aren’t stupid and most will actively resist participating in any process/activity they feel is a demonstration of patronizing oversight.

Classic standup structure is 1) what I did yesterday 2) What I”m doing today 3) blockers
I recommend framing that with the 20/80 rule or 10/10/80 rule. The first two can easily be surmised by commits or tickets. Digging into the blockers and dependancies for your team or between teams is the most efficacious use of your team’s time. It’s also the hardest. When people have known dependencies that can ask question or surface concerns. When there are unknown dependencies, you need to use your court vision to see or anticipate where things might go. You might be right; you might be wrong.

Really think about the cost of standup. You’re pulling all of your engineers and PMs together, so there’s the implicit cost. There’s also the opportunity cost. And lastly, there’s the context switching cost. Truth be told, these costs have nothing to do w/ standup and are present for any meeting.
COVID adds a wrinkle as some teams can benefit from the camaraderie of seeing each other in a semi casual environment. Previously that could have been waiting in line at the cold brew or sitting on a couch during company lunch.
