Post: be exceptional

Many people will probably give the vague advice to "stand out" or "be exceptional", but that's not the interpretation of the phrase I'm going for.

For startups to be successful, you need to be exceptional. You need to make exceptions for your behavior. When scaling, startups frequently need to roll out process to ensure that they can still execute at a high level.

But



We need to be mindful of the exceptions. Like people say about fashion: you need to know the rules to be able to break them.

Paul Graham has an famous post entitled "do things that don't scale".  People assume that means to just do anything and everything manually at first and worry about automating or building out a scalable process for things going forward. That's definitely part of it, but that route can also be problematic.

A classic startup exchange involves the relationship between engineering and customer success.

Whether it be a customer success team member turning around—because everyone is in one large open office—to talk directly with an engineer who worked a feature.

The newly minted process is setup to manage customer reported issues, usually through Zendesk and how it manifests as a an internal task (Jira ticket) for the product and engineering teams.

The new process stipulates that a customer success member processes the request, adds clarifying information, and then creates a Jira ticket. That Jira ticket is then triaged by a designated member of the product and engineering team to determine if it's an urgent but that needs to be addressed immediately, or if it's something that can wait until a future sprint.


Leverage 1-to-1 relationship, but that doesn't scale. Software scales. People relationships don't.
