Hi again. I threw a fresh coat of paint on the blog. I’m hoping to share more regularly in the coming months. I’ve got plenty of writing from past teams that I’d like to expand into longer pieces here. If there’s anything specific you’d like to hear about, let me know. I might experiment with Substack or other distribution options too, though I don’t plan to wire up email here (it’s easier than ever to roll your own these days).

It’s wild to realize my first post here was over ten years ago. Back then I was running on Ghost, which at the time was the shiny new hotness.

I’ve got a lot to cover—a few years’ worth. The last time I posted, I was at Mainstay. Since then, I’ve spent time at Google on the Spanner database team (hence the pun in the title), and for the past year I’ve been at Suno.
