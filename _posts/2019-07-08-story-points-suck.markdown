title: Story points suck

I’ve lost a full sprint’s worth of time debating what a story point is. What is it? It’s something that sucks. That’s it.

In my experience, just roll with it and try to get your teams to be consistent with whatever they are from one month to the next. Don't obsess over a unit of time or baseline, nor the purpose of using fibonacci numbers.
